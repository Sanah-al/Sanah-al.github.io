                <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
                <p class="text3">
Volunteering has been a constant and meaningful part of my life, consistently driven by the simple yet powerful principle of extending a helping hand. This mind-set has guided me through a spectrum of volunteer activities, all sharing the common goal of making a positive impact. My summer internship with the Windsor Police Service in 2017 not only provided valuable experience but also laid the foundation for a lasting connection, leading me to volunteer with them at various events.
